# csci2300-labs Short Descriptions - The code lacks comments.
Lab 1: A comparison of using recursion to find Fibonacci numbers versus an array with corresponding time graph. Times were found, recorded, then hard-coded in though.

Lab 2: A program to compare different adding algorithms and comparing the times it takes each algorithm for a random number of n digits.

Lab 3: A program to determine the primality of a number using Fermat's little theorem and also deliberately tests some Carmichael numbers as well and compares the probability versus the normal 1/2^k limit.

Lab 4: A randomized divide and conquer algorithm that returns the k-th smallest value in an array of integers.

Lab 5: A linear time (in graph theory) algorithm that takes a directed graph (lab5_test) and finds all Strongly Connected Components using Depth First Search.

Lab 6: A program that uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and finds the shortest path from v to all other vertices in the graph.

Lab 7: A Program which uses dynamic programming to compute the edit distance between two strings.
